### Abstract
While enteric pathogens have been widely studied for their roles in causing foodborne infection, their impacts on the gut microbial community have yet to be fully characterized. Previous work has identified notable changes in the gut microbiome related to pathogen invasion, both taxonomically and genetically. Characterization of the metabolic landscape during and after enteric infection, however, has not been explored. Consequently, we investigated the metabolome of paired stools recovered from 60 patients (cases) during and after recovery from enteric bacterial infections (follow-ups). Shotgun metagenomics was applied to predict functional pathways combined with untargeted metametabolomics classified by Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry. Notably, cases had a greater overall metabolic capacity with significantly higher pathway richness and evenness relative to the follow-ups (p<0.05). Metabolic pathways related to central carbon metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and lipid and fatty acid biosynthesis were more highly represented in cases and distinct signatures for menaquinone production were detected. By contrast, the follow-up samples had greater diversity of the actual metabolic landscape with enhanced richness of polar metabolites (p<0.0001) and significantly greater richness, evenness, and overall diversity of nonpolar metabolites (p<0.0001). Although many metabolites could not be annotated with existing databases, a marked increase in certain clusters of metabolites was observed in the follow-up samples when compared to the case samples. These findings suggest the importance of key metabolites in gut health and recovery and enhance understanding of metabolic fluctuations during enteric infections.
